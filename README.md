# HT-OS
An operating system built entirely in HTML, CSS & JavaScript. Everything needed for it to render on the web.


Picture this:


You see your NBN bill go through the roof, and you want to stay on top of your bill. But you still have a web browser popping up every time you turn on the computer, and you fall out of your routine. You don't want (and don't know how) to disable the internet card. With HT-OS, you can use your web browser to use an **_offline_** area for games and uttillities. And the web browser opens to HT-OS as well!
